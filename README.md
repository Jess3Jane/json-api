## JSON:API
A Rust implementation of the [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) spec focusing on correct serialization and deserialization. Should not be confused with [jsonapi-rust](https://github.com/michiel/jsonapi-rust). If you don't care about deserialization I would recommend using [json-api-rs](https://github.com/zacharygolba/json-api-rs) instead as its serialization model is quite good.
